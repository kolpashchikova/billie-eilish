I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before
Anyone before
Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored 
Lyin' for attention just to get neglection
Now we're estranged
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given
Not on his permission
Wasn't my decision
To be abused
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a "You mad at me?" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset
You're obsessed
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't dеserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend, too
I should have left when Drew
Said you were bad news
Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide
You better lock your phone
And look at me whеn you're alone
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin'
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression
Nobody saw me in the lobby
Nobody saw me in your arms
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like
You better lock your phone
And look at me when you're alone
Won't take a lot to get you goin'
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know
You better lock your door
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for
That heavy breathin' on the floor
I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I, I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
I know supposedly I'm lonely now
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone
But aren't I someone?
I'd like to be your answer
'Cause you're so handsome
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again
But I, I'm in love
With my future
And you don't know her
And I, I'm in love
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I love to rub it in like lotion
If you only pray on Sunday, could you come my way on Monday?
'Cause I like to do things God doesn't approve of if She saw us
She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
I wanna do bad things to you
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I need you for the oxytocin
If you find it hard to swallow, I can loosen up your collar
'Cause as long as you're still breathing
Don't you even think of leaving
Not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
You're gonna wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
Other people wouldn't stay
Other people don't obey
You and me are both the same
You should really run away
Bad things
I wanna do bad things to you
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well
"He hath come to the bosom of his beloved
Smiling on him, she beareth him to highest heav'n
With yearning heart"
"On thee we gaze, O' gold-wing'd messenger of mighty Gods"
Gold-winged angel
Go home, don't tell
Anyone what you are
You're sacred and they're starved
And their art is gettin' dark
And there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
They're gonna tell you what you wanna hear
Then they're gonna disappear
Gonna claim you like a souvenir
Just to sell you in a year
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
That's good
Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' likе it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
I used to think you were shy
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
So easy
Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
Think you're such a lost cause
But you got no job
What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now
What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now
I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was madе for you
For you
I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might havе fallen in love
What am I to do?
Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?
I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really, how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin'
I started walkin', gave no reaction
No reaction
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believе it
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated
I don't really wanna know why it went there
I kinda don't care
You wanna kill me?
You wanna hurt me?
Stop bein' flirty
It's kinda workin'
Did you really think this is the right thing to do?
Is it news? News to who?
That I really look just like the rest of you
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
And everybody said it was a letdown
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
Am I?
All these other inanimate bitches, it's none of my business
But don't you get sick of posin' for pictures
With that plastic body?
Man, I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone
"Everybody dies," that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control?
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know
You said you thought she was your age
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine?
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know
30 Under 30 for another year
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе
Maybе I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kaua'i where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
Shut his mouth, yeah
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now
Want it now
You can't give me up
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable
Got a lotta
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused
Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then, and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparablе years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal
But I loved you then, and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should, but I could never hate you
